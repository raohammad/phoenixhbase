# About

This is a simple proof of concept for Apache Phoenix integration with HBase.

HBASE: Apache HBaseâ„¢ is the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable, big data store. (as taken from project site)
PHOENIX: Apache Phoenix provides the flexibility of late-bound, schema-on-read capabilities from the NoSQL world by leveraging HBase as its backing store (as taken from project site)

In this we load huge amount of data from a CSV file directly into HBASE through Apache Phoenix. Apache Phoenix is lightning speed for data ingestion layer 

# Environment Settings

- Installation of HBase
- Installation of Phoenix
- Installation of SQuirreL SQL (a UI based client for Phoenix)

# Whats in this repository

- Sample data in CSV to load
- Sample Phoenix QL commands to create and load data
